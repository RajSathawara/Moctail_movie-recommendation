Architecture (high level):

React Frontend
     |
     |  (API calls)
     v
Python Backend (Flask / FastAPI)
     |
     |-- MySQL (User data, auth, preferences)
     |
     |-- ML Recommendation Engine
     |
     |-- Movie Dataset (CSV → DB or memory)



1️⃣   User Table (Auth data)
users
-----
user_id (PK)
name
email
password_hash
created_at

2️⃣   User Preferences Table (for “For You”)
user_preferences
----------------
id (PK)
user_id (FK)
movie_id
liked (yes/no)



👉 Next time you move system, you just run:

pip install -r requirements.txt



🔹 Phase 1 – Backend Setup (DONE ✅)

   Flask running
    connected
   Project structure ready

🔹 Phase 2 – ML Engine Creation (Now Starting 🚀)

This phase is independent from Flask.
We will:

   Load dataset
   Clean data
   Merge movies + credits
   Create "tags" column
   Apply TF-IDF
   Apply Cosine Similarity
   Create recommend(movie_name) function
   Only after this works, we connect it to API.

🔹 Phase 3 – API Integration

   Create /recommend route
   Connect recommendation function
   Return JSON response







there is some more changes i want you to do,

which is you can see when the user search a movie the movie result will show on a poster like where you changed the UI mistake by top to botom but the UI is still porblematic because if the poster is long or maybe because of the title of the mvoie which make the movie poster unmatched to the other posters by left to right , the allignment of the poster by left to right is not aligned , also i want a big change is when the user search something then first there will be a movie poster on the left side of that searched movie and at the rest of that poster image there will be movie discription and nambe highlated and then its other information that looks cool when the user search its recommendable movie , 

and then when he scrolls he find out its recommandation movies and then at the end he also gets the same genre movies but point to be noted that the genere of the movie which is suggested on explore more is not that good or accurate because when i searched "me before you " the movie genere is drama and rommance but the explore more is not showing the same genere movies and also you should show the movie which has all genere same then other genere related , as example : if the user search "me before you" movie than first the system will shows the movies which has genere like drama and rommance both on the genere than after either drama or rommance are there on any movie will shows and if there is no movie with same genere or with on of any genere of that searched movie than it will show somemessage that this genere movie is not available or something,
this changes must be there with one more thing is there untill a user logout the system, it will not automatically be move to welcome page while clicking on the title of the application intead it will navigate to dashboard page and only if the app is relaunch the user will not automatically logedout 

here if we run the ap.py and npm run dev the user have to login or register everytime because the system is restarting again and again so user have to insert the details but at actually on the browser of the user side it will not logout to the system auto matically from the user side untill he logout from the system
